      Liquid is open-source and licensed under the GNU GPL version 3. The game
      is played by using the bucket tool to fill territories with your colour of
      water. Once a territory is full, filling it with more water causes the
      weakest wall of the territory to collapse. All neighbouring territories
      are absorbed into the exploding territory. Their water is recoloured to
      your colour. This could potentially set off a chain reaction. You win when
      the entire map is filled with your colour. If you have no legal move, then
      you lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walls are coloured by strength&mdash;violet is strongest and red is
      weakest. Hovering over a territory will highlight the weakest wall.
